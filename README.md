# Hello-World
My first experience
Well hello folks,
I am a student of biobased products and bioenergy in Germany. 
Basically I'm interested in a bunch of areas so I am honing my skills at developing/programming. I speak English and German and some other languages fluently and currently learning some new ones. 
My current sports goal is running a marathon after various fitness challenges.

I am new to this place so I have no idea about anything, grateful for tips and such.

Have a great day!
